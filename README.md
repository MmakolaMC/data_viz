## Magalaweng Clive Mmakola


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

### Univariate Exploration

- Most borrowers preffered the 36 months loan term and this might be because the borrower rate is more reasonable depending which type of borrower

### Bivariate-Exploration

- Most of the borrowers preffered by lenders are those who are Employed, those who are homeowners, with high Prosper rating and score and those who are in the hight income range, and this might be because those in these categories are less likely to default

### Multivariate-Exploration

- Whether a borrower is a homeowner or not alone does not seem to have more effect on the borrower is approved for the loan or not
- The loan amount one takes is hightly correlated to the amount they will have to pay monthly and this also applies to the rates and the term of the loan
